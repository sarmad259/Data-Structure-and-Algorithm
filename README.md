# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Showcase 🧩

Welcome to my collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** projects and lab tasks, primarily implemented in **C++**. This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience solving a variety of problems, ranging from basic to complex algorithms and data structure implementations.

## What’s Inside?

- 📂 **Lab Tasks** — Step-by-step assignments covering core data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.  
- 🧰 **Algorithms** — Implementations of sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.  
- 🚀 **Complex Problems** — Challenging problems demonstrating problem-solving skills and algorithmic optimization.  
- 📝 **Code Style** — Clean, well-documented C++ code following best practices.  

## Skills Demonstrated

- Mastery of fundamental and advanced data structures  
- Strong problem-solving and debugging skills  
- Efficient algorithm implementation and optimization  
- Experience with both iterative and recursive approaches  
- Code modularity and reusability  

## How to Use

Feel free to explore individual files or folders to see my solutions. Each file includes comments and explanations to help understand the logic and approach.
